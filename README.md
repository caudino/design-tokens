# Contactlab Design Tokens

[![NPM version](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/@contactlab/design-tokens.svg)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@contactlab/design-tokens)

Design tokens are the visual design atoms of the design system â€” specifically, they are named entities that store visual design attributes. We use them in place of hard-coded values (such as hex values for color or pixel values for spacing) in order to maintain a scalable and consistent visual system for UI development.
